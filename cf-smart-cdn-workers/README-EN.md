### KV-Based Routing to External Domains (Simple User Guide)

You can now route requests from your Cloudflare domain to any external domain (even if it is not managed by Cloudflare) using KV storage for configuration.

#### Steps:

1. **Create a KV Namespace**
   - Name it `DOMAIN_ROUTER_KV` in your Cloudflare account.
   - Bind it to your Worker as `DOMAIN_ROUTER_KV`.

2. **Configure Routing Rules in KV**
   - Each key should be the request path (e.g., `/api/data`).
   - Each value should be the full target URL (e.g., `https://external.example.com/api/data`).
   - You can add/update these via the Cloudflare dashboard or APIâ€”no code changes required.

3. **How It Works**
   - When a request is received, the Worker looks up the path in `DOMAIN_ROUTER_KV`.
   - If a match is found, the request is proxied to the target URL.
   - If no match is found, a clear error message is returned.

#### Example KV Entry

| Key         | Value                                      |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `/api/data` | `https://external.example.com/api/data`     |

#### Error Handling
If a route is not configured or the target is unreachable, the Worker will return a helpful error message.

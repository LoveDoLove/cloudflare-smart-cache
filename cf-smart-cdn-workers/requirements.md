# Requirements - KV-Based Routing Worker (Spec-Driven Workflow v1)

## EARS Notation Requirements

1. WHEN a request is received on the Cloudflare domain, THE SYSTEM SHALL look up the target domain in the DOMAIN_ROUTER_KV storage and route the request accordingly.
2. IF the target domain is not configured in KV, THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL return a clear error message to the user.
3. THE SYSTEM SHALL provide a simple method for users to set or update routing rules via DOMAIN_ROUTER_KV (e.g., via Cloudflare dashboard or API).
4. THE SYSTEM SHALL handle errors gracefully and log failures for troubleshooting.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Routing works for any configured path in DOMAIN_ROUTER_KV.
- Unconfigured paths return a clear error message.
- Users can update routing rules via DOMAIN_ROUTER_KV without code changes.
- All error cases are handled and reported clearly.

## Traceability
- Linked to design and implementation in `worker.js` and documentation in `README-EN.md`.

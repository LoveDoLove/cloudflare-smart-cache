# DEPRECATED: `workers` Folder

## Deprecation Notice

The `workers` folder and all files within it are now **deprecated** and should not be used for new development. This deprecation follows the advanced reasoning, documentation, and modularity requirements outlined in the InjectMCP prompt (see project root for details).

### Actionable Guidance
- **Do not** add new code or features to this folder.
- For new development, refer to updated modules or consult project maintainers for guidance.
- If you must reference legacy code, ensure you clearly mark any usage as deprecated and document migration plans.

### Reason for Deprecation
This folder is deprecated to enforce modularity, maintainability, and alignment with current best practices for Cloudflare Workers and smart cache solutions (Cloudflare Docs, 2024; Mozilla, 2024).
